Objective: Deploy a robust and scalable open-source ERP solution, Odoo, on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using a comprehensive DevOps approach.

Source Code Management: Utilized Azure Repos for efficient and secure source code management.
Continuous Integration (CI): Implemented Azure Pipelines for automated CI, ensuring high-quality code through testing and integration.
Container Registry: Stored private Docker images in Azure Container Registry (ACR), facilitating secure and efficient container management.
Deployment: Created Helm charts to streamline deployments across various environments, enhancing operational efficiency.
Continuous Delivery (CD): Adopted a GitOps approach with ArgoCD, which actively monitors for changes in Helm charts to ensure synchronization with the AKS cluster.
Service Leveraged: AKS, Azure DevOps, Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines, Azure Container Registry, Helm, ArgoCD.
This setup simplifies our deployment process, ensuring consistency, scalability, and reliability across all environments.
